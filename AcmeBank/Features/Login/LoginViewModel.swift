/// Holds all `@Published` state consumed by `LoginView` and exposes two
/// entry points:
///
///   - `signInTapped()` — fires the legacy `onSignIn` closure if set
///     (preserved so existing callers / previews / unit tests that wire
///     a closure directly continue to work).
///   - `signIn(username:password:keepSignedIn:)` — calls the injected
///     `AuthService` directly, driving the `isSigningIn` loading state
///     and mapping any `AuthError` into the exact user-facing copy
///     declared in MD065-7.
///
/// The async path is what `LoginView` invokes from the Sign-in button
/// and what `AcmeBankApp` observes via `signedInSession` to swap the
/// root to `LandingView`. The closure path is left in place because
/// the `LoginViewModelTests` suite still exercises it; new wiring
/// should target the async path.
///
/// Annotated `@MainActor` to guarantee that every `@Published` mutation
/// — including those *after* the `await authService.signIn(...)`
/// suspension point — runs on the main thread. Without this annotation
/// the post-await mutations would run on whatever executor the
/// `AuthService` resumed onto (e.g. a background thread inside the Okta
/// SDK), producing "Publishing changes from background threads is not
/// allowed" runtime warnings and risking dropped renders. The
/// annotation also makes the `isSigningIn` re-entry guard atomic: two
/// Tasks racing into `signIn(...)` are now serialized on the main
/// actor's executor, so the check-then-set can't interleave.
